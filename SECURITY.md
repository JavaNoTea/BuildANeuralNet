# Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in the Neural Network Builder application to protect against common vulnerabilities and ensure secure operation in production environments.

## üîí Security Architecture

### 1. Code Execution Security

**Problem**: The application allows users to execute Python code for neural network training, which poses significant security risks.

**Solution**: Implemented secure code execution using RestrictedPython with the following protections:

- **Sandboxed Execution**: All user code runs in a restricted Python environment
- **AST Analysis**: Code is analyzed before execution to detect dangerous patterns
- **Module Whitelisting**: Only approved modules (torch, numpy, etc.) are available
- **Pattern Detection**: Blocks known malicious patterns (eval, exec, imports, etc.)
- **Timeout Protection**: Code execution is limited to prevent infinite loops
- **Resource Limits**: Memory and CPU usage are monitored and restricted

```python
# Example: Secure code execution
from secure_executor import SecureExecutor

executor = SecureExecutor(timeout=300)
result = executor.execute_safe(user_code)
```

### 2. Authentication & Authorization

**Enhanced Password Security**:
- Minimum 8 characters with complexity requirements
- Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters required
- Protection against common passwords and sequential patterns
- Bcrypt hashing with salt

**Login Protection**:
- Rate limiting: 5 attempts per minute
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts (30-minute duration)
- IP-based blocking for suspicious activity
- Session management with secure JWT tokens

**Token Security**:
- Access tokens expire in 30 minutes
- Refresh tokens expire in 7 days
- Proper token validation and rotation
- Secure token storage practices

```python
# Example: Password validation
from auth import PasswordValidator

is_valid, errors = PasswordValidator.validate_password_strength(password)
if not is_valid:
    raise ValueError(f"Password validation failed: {'; '.join(errors)}")
```

### 3. API Security

**CORS Protection**:
- Specific origin allowlist (no wildcards)
- Restricted HTTP methods and headers
- Credential handling properly configured

**Rate Limiting**:
- Different limits for different endpoints
- 5 requests/minute for authentication
- 60 requests/minute for general API access
- Prevents abuse and DoS attacks

**Security Headers**:
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

**Input Validation**:
- Comprehensive input sanitization
- UUID format validation for IDs
- Email format validation
- Parameter bounds checking

### 4. Data Security

**Encryption at Rest**:
- Sensitive data encrypted using Fernet (symmetric encryption)
- Model data, payment information, and personal data protected
- Encryption keys managed through environment variables

**Database Security**:
- Connection pooling with secure configurations
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Database connection encryption (SSL required for PostgreSQL)
- Audit logging for all database operations

```python
# Example: Encrypted field
@property
def phone(self) -> Optional[str]:
    if self._encrypted_phone:
        return EncryptedField.decrypt(self._encrypted_phone)
    return None

@phone.setter
def phone(self, value: Optional[str]):
    if value:
        self._encrypted_phone = EncryptedField.encrypt(value)
```

### 5. Infrastructure Security

**Container Security**:
- Multi-stage Docker builds with minimal base images
- Regular vulnerability scanning with Trivy
- Non-root user execution
- Security-focused base images

**Environment Security**:
- All secrets managed through environment variables
- No hardcoded credentials in code
- Secure defaults for all configurations
- Environment-specific settings

**Network Security**:
- TrustedHost middleware to prevent host header attacks
- Proper handling of proxy headers
- Secure cookie configuration

### 6. Monitoring & Logging

**Security Event Logging**:
- Comprehensive logging of all security events
- Real-time threat detection and alerting
- Failed login attempt tracking
- Suspicious activity pattern detection

**Performance Monitoring**:
- Response time tracking
- Resource usage monitoring
- System metrics collection
- Automated alerting for anomalies

**Audit Trail**:
- All user actions logged with timestamps
- IP address and user agent tracking
- Database change auditing
- Retention policies for log data

```python
# Example: Security event logging
from monitoring import SecurityEvent, SecurityEventType, AlertSeverity

event = SecurityEvent(
    event_type=SecurityEventType.FAILED_LOGIN,
    user_id=user_id,
    ip_address=client_ip,
    severity=AlertSeverity.MEDIUM,
    description="Invalid login attempt"
)
security_monitor.log_security_event(event, db)
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Frontend Security

### Client-Side Protection

**Input Sanitization**:
- XSS prevention through input sanitization
- HTML encoding of user-generated content
- Safe object key validation

**API Security**:
- CSRF token generation and validation
- Request timeout protection
- Response content type validation
- Rate limiting on client side

**Authentication Security**:
- Secure token storage
- Automatic token refresh
- Proper logout handling
- Session timeout management

```typescript
// Example: Input sanitization
static sanitizeInput(input: any): any {
  if (typeof input === 'string') {
    return input
      .replace(/[<>'"]/g, '') // Remove dangerous characters
      .trim()
      .slice(0, 10000); // Limit length
  }
  // ... additional sanitization logic
}
```
